    "# GitHub Copilot in VS Code — Chat, Edit, and Agent Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a companion to your 20‑minute Copilot talk.  \n",
    "It explains the three primary ways you'll interact with Copilot in **VS Code**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chat mode** – Ask questions, get explanations, and generate code in a side/chat panel.  \n",
    "2. **Edit mode (Inline Chat / Copilot Edits)** – Tell Copilot *how* to modify the code you’ve selected or the current file.  \n",
    "3. **Agent mode** – Use **@‑mentions** to invoke Copilot **agents** (e.g., `@workspace`, `@vscode`, `@terminal`) and operate on broader context.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also covers **useful shortcuts**, the **Add Context…** button, **@‑mentions**, and **slash commands**.\n"

    "## 1) Chat Mode (Side Panel)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** A chat panel in VS Code where you can ask questions in plain English (or code) and get answers, code snippets, and explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to open it:**\n",
    "- Click the **Copilot** (chat) icon in the Activity Bar (left).  \n",
    "- Or open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run: **“Copilot: Focus on Chat”**.  \n",
    "- If you have a keybinding, use it (e.g., some setups use `Ctrl+Shift+I`). If it doesn’t work, go to **File → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts** and search **“Copilot Chat”** to see or set yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to ask in Chat:**\n",
    "- “Explain this function” (paste the function).  \n",
    "- “Write a pandas example that groups by month and sums revenue.”  \n",
    "- “Turn this plain English into working Python code with comments.”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demo script (in class):**\n",
    "1. Open Chat.  \n",
    "2. Ask: *“Create a Python function `clean_names(s: str)` that trims spaces, lowercases, and replaces spaces with underscores. Include docstring and tests.”*  \n",
    "3. Paste the result into a file, run it, show quick edits with **Edit mode** (next section).\n"

    "\n",
    "In Copilot Chat you’ll see **Add Context…**. Use it to attach **specific context** so Copilot gives more accurate answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Files / Folders** — point Copilot at the exact files (e.g., `utils.py`, `notebooks/01_intro.ipynb`).  \n",
    "- **Selection** — include the code you’ve highlighted.  \n",
    "- **Problems / Terminal / Git** — include open issues, recent terminal output, or recent commits.  \n",
    "- **Open Editors / Active Notebook** — share what you’re currently working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example prompts using Add Context…**\n",

    "\n",
    "**What it is:** A focused way to ask Copilot to **edit your current selection or file**. You write an instruction, Copilot proposes a change, you **review a diff**, then **Apply** or **Discard**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to start Edit mode:**\n",
    "- Select code → press **Inline Chat** (commonly `Ctrl+I` on Windows; if not, search **“Inline Chat: Start”** in Keyboard Shortcuts).\n",

    "2. Select it, start **Inline Chat**.  \n",
    "3. Prompt: *“Add robust input validation and examples; keep PEP‑8 naming.”*  \n",

    "\n",
    "- `@workspace` — understands the project’s files and structure; good for repo‑wide questions.  \n",

    "- `@terminal` — references terminal output.  \n",
    "- `@notebook` — focuses on the active Jupyter notebook.  \n",
    "- `@github` — interacts with GitHub context (PRs, issues) if connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- `@workspace` *“Find all uses of the function `clean_names` and propose a unified signature; show a migration diff.”*  \n",
    "- `@vscode` *“Create a VS Code task to run `pytest -q` and add it to tasks.json.”*  \n",
    "- `@terminal` *“Given the last `pip install` error, suggest the correct command to resolve version conflicts.”*  \n",
    "- `@notebook` *“Summarize the current notebook and create a new cell with a function that wraps the top 3 cells.”*\n",
